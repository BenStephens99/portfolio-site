                            <p>My name is Ben and I am a recent graduate from the University of Brighton with a first-class
                                degree in Computer Science. I am excited to begin my journey as a Front-End Developer and
                                am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to create engaging and user-friendly websites
                                and web applications.</p>

                            <p>Throughout my time at university, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of
                                projects, both individually and as part of a team. These projects have allowed me to
                                develop my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end technologies. I am also
                                well-versed in web design principles and user experience design, which I believe are crucial
                                for creating websites that are both visually appealing and easy to navigate.</p>

                            <p>On my portfolio website, you will find a selection of my most recent projects,
                                along with detailed explanations of the technologies and techniques I used to create them.
                                I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for any Front-End Developer
                                position and I look forward to the opportunity to work with a team of talented developers to create
                                innovative and engaging websites and web applications.</p>
